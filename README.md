# oura-to-beeminder

A Clojure library designed to sync sleep score data from your Oura ring to Beeminder. By default, it will attempt to idempotently update sleep data for the last 4 days in Beeminder. It will not update days for which there is already sleep data, even if the data differs from what is in Oura.

You will need an Oura developer auth token as well as a Beeminder developer auth token.

## Usage

Create `profiles.clj` if you are developing. It will look like this:

```
{:dev  {:env {:oura-token "SOME_TOKEN1"
              :beeminder-token "SOME_TOKEN2"
              :beeminder-user "USERNAME1"
              :beeminder-goal-id "GOAL_ID1"}}
 :test {:env {:oura-token "SOME_TOKEN1"
              :beeminder-token "SOME_TOKEN2"
              :beeminder-user "USERNAME1"
              :beeminder-goal-id "GOAL_ID1"}}}
```

Run with `lein run`.

You can also compile with `lein uberjar` and run the binary with `BEEMINDER_TOKEN=x OURA_TOKEN=y java -jar beeminder_to_oura-standalone.jar`
